# TelecomChurnGroupCaseStudy

## Short Description
ML Model to predict churn for a lending telecom operator in South East Asia

## Business Description :
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another.

## Problem Statement
- In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. 
- It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators.
- In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.
- Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition to reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

## Objective of the Project
- The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will the following purposes:
    - to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
    - to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
    -  Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.
    - Use a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA to handle large number of attributes and then build a predictive model
