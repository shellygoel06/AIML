    "We need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, we can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",

    "With the help of topic modelling, we will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. we can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, we can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.</td>\n",

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.</td>\n",

It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent! XXXX has the recording of the agent who was misled me.   \n",

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it wa through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21  on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

       "21   on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",
